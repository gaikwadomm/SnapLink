# 📌 LinkNest

> A secure, organized, and efficient way to save and manage important web links you come across.

## 📝 Description

**LinkNest** is a personal bookmark manager web application that allows users to quickly save important web links using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

The app captures metadata such as the site title and optionally allows users to add tags or notes. Each link is encrypted before being stored in the database to ensure privacy and data security.

With a clean and intuitive interface, **LinkNest** acts as your digital vault of essential links — organized, searchable, and always available for future reference.

> The goal is to make saving and managing useful web links as seamless and secure as possible.
